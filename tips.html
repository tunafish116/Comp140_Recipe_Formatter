1. Don't access nested elements directly. This because you can't do double subscripts in recipies.
Example:
    instead of: 
        grid[1][2] = 3
    use:
        grid[1] = row
        row[2] = 3

this also applies to nested dictionaries as well.




2. Avoid nested parentheses. It breaks my regex, and I'm not making a full blown
 interpreter for this. Also, it makes your code more readable anyways, which is
 good when you want to translate it into a recipe.
Example:
    instead of:
        list.append((tempF-32)*5/9)
    use:
        tempC = (tempF-32)*5/9
        list.append(tempC)




3. Why can't it write my inputs and outputs WAAAAAHH

The point of this tool is to show how stupid certain aspects of recipes are.
The fact a couple lines of replaceAll using regex can get you to 80% of a full
recipe is proof that writing recipe steps is redundant work, and is basically
porting your python program to another language. Inputs and outputs, however,
actually require brainpower to write, and to automate that task would require
something like ChatGPT. This aspect of recipies can at least be justified in 
the name of learning. This is not a tool for avoiding learning.
Sorry you'll still have to write your inputs and outputs yourself :3
